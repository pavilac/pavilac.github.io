I hold a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from the University of Cuenca (2017) and a master's degree in Wireless Communications from the University of Southampton (2019). Currently, I'm pursuing a Ph.D. in Time-sensitive Networking at Ghent University and imec's Internet Technology and Data Science Lab (IDLab), focusing on deterministic wireless communications within mixed wireless-wired environments, particularly the IEEE 802.11 standard. I'm also interested in integrating IoT technologies seamlessly and applying machine learning in wireless communications. Open to collaborations and discussions aligning with my research interests.

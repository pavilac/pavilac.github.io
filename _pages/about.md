With a background in telecommunications engineering and a Master's degree in Wireless Communications, I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Wireless Time-Sensitive Networks at IDLab. My research is dedicated to enabling Wireless Time-Sensitive Networks to facilitate real-time applications across various industries.

I am deeply passionate about leveraging machine learning to drive innovation in wireless networks, and I am particularly fascinated by the potential of Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) for IoT applications.

I am enthusiastic about collaborating and connecting with like-minded professionals to collectively shape the future of wireless communications.
